# VanFlow Specification

VanFlow is a specification for the issuance of events from components of the
implementation of a Virtual Application Network (VAN) for the purpose of
observing the operation of the VAN.  VanFlow is similar in concept to NetFlow,
but differs in that VanFlow provides data at a higher level of abstraction and
touches higher level concepts like processes and network topology.

## Transport

The VAN implementation that VanFlow is built for is the Skupper implementation.
Since Skupper is built on the foundation of an AMQP network, the VanFlow
content is transferred using AMQP messages and multicast addressing.

Reference the [AMQP 1.0 Specification][amqp].

VanFlow messages are AMQP-formatted messages with the following characteristics

- The **Properties.to** field contains the destination address of the message
- The **Properties.subject** field contains the operation-code for the message.
  The operation codes are BEACON, RECORD, and FLUSH
- The **ApplicationProperties** section contains operation-code-specific
  arguments
- The **Body** section is an **AMQPValue** section containing
  operation-code-specific contents

The following addresses are used when transferring VanFlow messages:

- `mc/sfe.all` - BEACON messages are sent via this address (multicast
  forwarding.) This is the only well-known address an event collector requires
  to participate in the VanFlow protocol. BEACON messages should contain the
  addresses to use in order to communicate with that event source.
- `sfe.<source-identity>` - FLUSH messages are sent to this address.  The source-identity
  is the identity of the event source to which the message is being sent
  (anycast forwarding)
- `mc/sfe.<source-identity>` - RECORD and HEARTBEAT messages are sent via this address from the
  source that has the included identity (multicast forwarding)
- `mc/sfe.<source-identity>.flows` - event sources that publish FLOW records
  will send RECORD messages containing FLOW records via this suffixed address
  instead of the default address. This way event collectors can opt-in to
  receiving the high volume events associated with FLOWS.

## Message Types

### BEACON

The BEACON message is transmitted periodically by every VanFlow event source.
Event sources include ROUTERs, CONTROLLERs, and COLLECTORs.  All BEACON
messages are sent using the mc/sfe.all multicast address.

The purpose of the BEACON message is to allow event collectors to discover
sources of events.  Once a collector has discovered the existence of an event
source, it may optionally subscribe to receive VanFlow record events from that
source.

| Field    | Type    | Value or Description    |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Properties.To | str8-utf8 | mc/sfe.all
| Properties.Subject | str8-utf8, sym8 | BEACON
| ApplicationProperties.v | smalluint | 1 (Protocol Version)
| ApplicationProperties.sourceType | str8-utf8 | The record type for the event source (e.g. ROUTER, CONTROLLER, COLLECTOR)
| ApplicationProperties.address | str8-utf8 | The address on which event records are sent from this source. By convention this is `mc/sfe.<source-identity>`.
| ApplicationProperties.direct | str8-utf8 | The address to which messages can be sent directly to this source. By convention this is `sfe.<source-identity>`.
| ApplicationProperties.id | str8-utf8 | The event source’s record identifier.

### HEARTBEAT

Like the BEACON message, the HEARTBEAT message is also sent periodically by
each event source.  Unlike the BEACON message, the HEARTBEAT message is sent to
the source-specific multicast address so that it is only received by collectors
that have explicitly subscribed to events from that source.

| Field    | Type    | Value or Description    |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Properties.To | str8-utf8 | mc/sfe.source-identity
| Properties.Subject | str8-utf8, sym8 | HEARTBEAT
| ApplicationProperties.v | smalluint | 1 (Protocol Version)
| ApplicationProperties.id | str8-utf8 | The event source’s record identifier.
| ApplicationProperties.now | ulong | The event source’s current time.

### RECORD

The RECORD message is transmitted by event sources.  The message carries a set
of incremental record updates that can be collected and aggregated by
collectors.  Updates are incremental in that for a given flow record, the same
attribute value shall not be sent multiple times.  Attributes are re-sent only
if their value has changed since the last update.  The only attributes that are
included in all of the updates are the RECORD_TYPE and IDENTITY attributes.

| Field    | Type    | Value or Description    |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Properties.To | str8-utf8 | The address to which the RECORD message is sent. Usually mc/sfe.source-identity.
| Properties.Subject | str8-utf8, sym8 | RECORD
| Body.AMQP_Value | list32 | List of map8/map32 where the key is the Attribute Code and Value is the Attribute Value.

### FLUSH

The FLUSH message is sent by a collector to a specific event source.  When the
event source receives the FLUSH request, it responds by sending non-incremental
updates for all currently active records (see the Lifecycle section below).  A
non-incremental update includes all attributes of a record.  FLUSH is used when
a new collector comes online and discovers (via a BEACON message) a new event
source.  It allows the collector to receive a baseline of all complete active
records from the source.

| Field    | Type    | Value or Description    |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Properties.To | str8-utf8 | Address of the event source as found in the BEACON.ApplicationProperties.direct field
| Properties.Subject | str8-utf8, sym8 | FLUSH

## Record Codepoints

Record codepoints are numeric values that appear in RECORD messages to
represent record types and record attribute types.

## Record Lifecycle

### Event Source

The lifecycle of a VanFlow record is observable via the START_TIME and END_TIME
attributes.  START_TIME is the local timestamp stored at the moment the record
is created on the event source.  Every record has a start time.

END_TIME is provided in the record’s final update as the timestamp of the
moment when the record was deleted on the event source.

Any record that has a START_TIME but no END_TIME is considered “active” as it
represents a currently-existing object in the context of the event source.
Once a record is deleted and the terminal update is sent, the record is removed
and no further updates are ever sent, even in response to a FLUSH request.

### Event Collector

Within the context of an event collector, records are not necessarily deleted.
A record that has an END_TIME will remain available for viewing as an
historical record, representing what has happened in the past.

It is also possible for a record to become stale.  In other words, the record’s
lifecycle may be considered complete even if the collector does not receive an
explicit end-time for the record.  The collector may keep track of the last
time an active record was updated.  If this time becomes too far in the past,
the collector may mark the record as stale and exclude it from the results of
queries looking for active records.

The implementation of an event collector may optionally purge historical
records for the purpose of saving memory and storage space.

## Identifiers and References

Every VanFlow record has a unique identifier.  Records may contain explicit
references to other records by storing the other record’s identifier in a
reference attribute (PARENT, COUNTERFLOW, etc).

Record identifiers are arbitrary strings.

SITE record identity must be stable throughout the lifecycle of the VAN
network.  As such, it must not contain any text that might change if the
emitting source is re-started.

## Hierarchy and Peer Linkage

VanFlow records are arranged in a hierarchical and connected structure using
identity reference attributes.  The hierarchy is established via the PARENT
attribute.  The following diagram illustrates the record-type hierarchy:

```mermaid
---
title: Record Peer Linkage
---
flowchart BT;
    s["Site"];
    proc["Process"] --> s;
    ctrlr["Controller"] --> s;
    rtr["Router"] --> s;
    ra["Router Access"] --> rtr;
    link["Link"] -->|peer| ra;
    link["Link"] --> rtr;
    lst["Listener"] --> rtr;
    cnctr["Connector"] --> rtr;
    cnctr["Connector"] --> proc;
    flow["Biflow"]
    flow --> lst;
    flow --> cnctr;
    flow -.-> proc;
```

In the above diagram, any linkage that is unlabelled should be assumed to be
PARENT.  Note that FLOW records can be children of either CONNECTOR, LISTENER,
or other FLOW records.  A FLOW within a FLOW represents a layer-7 protocol flow
encapsulated within a layer-4 protocol flow (e.g. HTTP within TCP, where TCP is
the parent of HTTP).

### BIFLOW Linkage

```mermaid

title: BIFLOW Linkage

flowchart BT;
    sL["Site"];
    rL["Router"] -->sL;
    Listener --> rL;

    pL["Process"] --> sL;
    sC["Site"];
    rC["Router"] -->sC;
    Connector --> rC;
    Connector --> pC;
    pC["Process"] --> sC;

    bf["BIFLOW_TPORT"] --> Listener;
    bf --> |connector| Connector;
    bf -.-> |source Host+Port| pL;

    bfapp["BIFLOW_APP"] --> bf;
```

### Collector-Inferred Linkage

Some of the links that form associations between records cannot be supplied by
the original event source and must be added later by the collector.

FLOW to PROCESS linkages are formed by correlating the IP addresses in
SOURCE_HOST and DESTINATION_HOST to the IP addresses (and possibly ports) of
the PROCESS records.

COUNTERFLOW linkages are provided in only one direction by the event sources.
The connector-side flow contains a counterflow link to the listener-side flow.
The collector should add in the opposite-direction counterflow link for the
listener-side flow record.  This causes the flow records to mutually reference
each other as counterflows.
